AI Hackathon 2025 — Building smarter, simpler digital tools for real life.




Prompt 





Create a complete, responsive, and interactive web application called Vibe Coding — a color-coded, all-in-one life and productivity dashboard designed for creators, learners, and builders.
The app should feel like a personal operating system that balances productivity, wellbeing, creativity, and focus — all through elegant visuals and fluid interactions.

Use React + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript, and ensure a clean modular folder structure (src/pages, src/components, src/hooks, etc.).
Implement routing with React Router DOM and store data in LocalStorage by default (with Firebase sync as an optional upgrade).
The site must be deployable to Vercel or Netlify and should support PWA installation.

🧭 Core Sections

The app contains seven main sections: Health, Enjoy, Mind, Work, Growth, Home, and Time, plus Settings and a Dashboard.
Each section has its own color palette, icons, and animations to reflect its “vibe.”
All pages connect to a central Dashboard that summarizes daily progress and visualizes balance across all areas.

🎨 Design & Feel

Adopt a calm, minimal, and futuristic interface.
Use color psychology:

Health — fresh green tones

Enjoy — warm orange tones

Mind — cool blue tones

Work — deep professional blues

Growth — purple tones for ambition

Home — red tones for warmth

Time — yellow tones for productivity

Settings — gray tones for neutrality

Typography: “Inter” or “SF Pro Display”, modern and readable.
Apply smooth animations (Framer Motion) for transitions and feedback.
Add hover states, ripple effects, and soft gradients to create flow and immersion.

⚙️ Core Functionalities

Dashboard — a “Today” view showing total progress, energy levels, and active goals with a rainbow progress bar called the Life Overview Bar.
Health — food, water, sleep, and exercise tracking with quick-add buttons and circular progress visualizations.
Mind — to-do list, journal, mood tracker, and focus timer (Pomodoro) with ambient calm zone.
Work — project planner, task tracker, deadline reminders, and a daily productivity chart.
Growth — habit tracker, skill bars, streaks, and achievements (badges and confetti for milestones).
Home — chores, shopping lists, bills, and routines with friendly reminders.
Time — calendar, countdowns, focus mode, and smart reminders.
Settings — profile, theme, notification, and backup options.

💫 Interactivity & UX

Implement a fixed top navbar with icons for each section and a bottom dock with quick actions (Add, Focus, Summary, Settings).
Include a floating “Today Widget” showing daily stats (e.g., water intake, mood, streak).
Animations should feel intuitive, with a sense of progress and calm energy — for example, confetti when completing goals, glowing checkmarks, or breathing-style transitions during focus mode.

Ensure all features support CRUD (add/edit/delete) and save instantly to LocalStorage.
Enable offline access and data export/import (JSON file).

🔐 Data & Logic

Use TypeScript interfaces for data models like User, Task, Habit, and HealthEntry.
Keep structure flexible for future sync with Firebase.
Use hooks for managing state (e.g., useHealth, useMind, useWork).

🧩 Accessibility & Performance

Mobile-first responsive design

Lazy load charts and media

Keyboard shortcuts: L (log water), F (focus timer), N (new note)

Semantic HTML + ARIA labels

Contrast ratio minimum 4.5:1

Fast page transitions and no blocking scripts

🧠 Output Expectation

Generate a complete scaffolded React + Tailwind project with working routes and placeholders for all sections.
Include at least one functional interactive component per page (e.g., add task, start timer, toggle habit).
Ensure clean code, consistent theming, and modular components.
Provide sample data and a minimal README with setup instructions.

The finished app should feel like a digital extension of life itself — a color-coded, peaceful, and motivating environment where focus meets creativity.
